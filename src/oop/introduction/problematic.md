# Functional programming vs Object-Oriented Programming

---

## Problematic:

Write a program to read the lengths of the sides of two triangles X and Y (assume lengths
valid). Then show the value of the areas of the two triangles and say which of the two triangles
has the largest area.
The formula for calculating the area of a triangle from the measures of its sides a, b and c is
following (Heron's formula):

**area** = _sqrt_(p * (p - a) * (p - b) * (p - c))

**p** = a + b + c / 2

> Example:
```shell
Enter the measures of triangle X:
3.00
4.00
5.00
Enter the measures of triangle Y:
7.50
4.50
4.02
Triangle X area: 6.0000
Triangle Y area: 7.5638
Larger area: Y
```
