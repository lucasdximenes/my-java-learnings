     * Static members are members of a class that are not associated with any
     * particular instance of that class. They are associated with the class
     * itself. Static members are shared by all instances of the class.
     *
     * Static members are declared using the static `keyword`.
     * Static members are accessed using the class name.
     * Static members are initialized when the class is loaded.
     * Static members are used to implement class-level functionality.
     * Static members are used to implement constants:
     *  public static final String CONSTANT = "Good practice in java, constants are in uppercase = CONSTANT_CONSTANT";
     *
     * Common applications of static members:
     * - Constants
     * - Utility classes
     *
     * A class that contains only static members can be a static class.
